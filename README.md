# C Compiler

[Using the C11 standard](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf)

It will probably be very simplified.

I hope to be able to bootstrap this compiler.

## To Do

- [ ] Lexer
- [ ] Recursive Descent Parser

Functions such as printf will be built in for debugging purposes and also linking with the actual c standard library would be impossible unless I worked on this for months straight.
